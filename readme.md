## Setup

1. Create a `.env` file and add the following:

```
DISCORD_TOKEN=<Your_DC_Bot_Token>
```

2. Install requirements from `requirement.txt`

You can use Conda (Discord requires a special installation in Conda, so you’ll need to install it separately :D):

```
conda install -r requirement.txt
conda install conda-forge::discord.py
```

or use pip:

```
pip install -r requirement.txt
```

3. Run `main.py`:

```
python main.py
```
